The book’s 13 chapters explore principles that statesmen around the globe have employed for centuries to defeat their enemies at war.<br /><br />Sun Tzu starts by mapping out the five fundamental factors that lead to war. He then covers a wide range of topics, from avoiding conflict altogether to strategically positioning soldiers, pulling off tactical maneuvers, and putting spies to use.<br /><br />Despite the technological advances made since <i>The Art of War</i> was published, Sun Tzu is still considered one of history’s foremost military strategists, and his methods still ring true. While he wrote the book as a manual for those who would literally wield swords, it has reached a much broader audience in this day and age. Warriors of all kinds-like corporate leaders or athletes-seek out Sun Tzu’s wisdom in their quest for success.",

            "description": "An Apple Books Classic edition.<br /><br /> Jane Austen’s beloved classic opens with this witty and very memorable line: “It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.” With all the twists and turns of a soap opera, <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> chronicles the drama that ensues when the wealthy bachelor Mr. Darcy moves close to the Bennet family home in the English countryside. The news of his arrival sends the socially ambitious Mrs. Bennet-whose main concern is finding suitable matches for her five daughters-into overdrive.<br /><br /> The book’s main character, the high-spirited Elizabeth Bennet, is a strikingly modern heroine: a woman who refuses to lower her expectations or transform herself to suit society’s norms. Austen’s novel achieves a remarkable balance, serving up barbed criticism of the obsession with money, status, and matrimony even as it draws us into a swoon-worthy love story. At its heart, <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> is a romantic comedy, and a darned great one at that. It’s so much fun to turn the pages and wonder about Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy: Will they or won’t they overcome their excessive pride and initial prejudices to make a happily-ever-after connection?",

            "description": "An Apple Books Classic edition.<br /><br />\nWritten by the founding father of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud’s 1899 book is the definitive text on learning to interpret dreams. Freud’s groundbreaking approach to healing psychiatric issues through dialogue between a patient and therapist gave us enduring concepts like projection and transference, as well as the superego, ego, and id.<br /><br />\nAbove all, Freud advanced the progressive idea of unconscious desire as a driving force for our thoughts and actions. This paved the way for the revolutionary notion that dreams are more than wild nonsense-they’re a channel for symbolically communicating our innermost fears, conflicts, and desires. While many of Freud’s theories have fallen out of fashion, <i>Dream Psychology</i> is a great introduction to the influential field of psychoanalysis. It’s a fascinating look into the world of the subconscious-and the human mind.",
